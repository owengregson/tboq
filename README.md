# tboq
"tboq" was a malicious Tampermonkey script that scraped Discord tokens from the user's browser cache.

On it's own, this script is harmless as it is not configured with an API endpoint to post the data to.
However, when configured correctly so that the script can post data, the script would post sensitive information from it's victims to the API endpoint.

NOTE: This script is provided for educational purposes only, and was never deployed/released publicly.
Causing malware to be installed on someone else's computer is a criminal offense for which you could face state or federal charges.
